# LSTM-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-2D-Pose_Pytorch
Based on PyTorch library, realizing human activities recognition using 2D skeleton joint points

- Basic idea is from [RNN-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-2D-Pose-Input](https://github.com/stuarteiffert/RNN-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-2D-Pose-Input)
- Realizing LSTM network by PyTorch
- Data can be downloaded from [raw data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuZlyNjg6DMQE3iaO1Px6h1yLKgatynt/view)
- Detail is in [LSTM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuZlyNjg6DMQE3iaO1Px6h1yLKgatynt/view)
